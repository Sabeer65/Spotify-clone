# Spotify Clone Project

**Note: The site is live at [https://spotifyclone2025.netlify.app/](https://spotifyclone2025.netlify.app/). The backend is hosted on Render, so it might take a little time to initially load.**

Hey there! This is a basic Spotify clone I built to show how some of the music streaming service's core stuff works. It uses a bunch of web tech (MERN stack) and looks pretty good thanks to Tailwind CSS.

## What You Can Do Here

* **Browse Music:** Check out some albums, playlists, and artists.
* **Control the Music:** Play, pause, and skip tracks.
* **Nice Design:** The layout is modern and looks good on different devices.
* **Admin Stuff:** Functionality to add and manage playlists and songs. The admin section, located in the `admin` folder, is where you can add and manage the content that is displayed on the main page.

## What I Used

Here's the tech I used to build this:

* Frontend (what you see):

    * React: To build the user interface.
    * Tailwind CSS: To make it look nice and work on different screens.
* Backend (what makes it work):

    * Node.js: The base for the server.
    * Express.js: To help build the server.
    * MongoDB: To store the data.

## How to Run It

Want to run this project on your computer? Here's how:

1.  **Grab the code:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Sabeer65/Spotify-clone.git](https://github.com/Sabeer65/Spotify-clone.git)
    ```
2.  **Go to the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd Spotify-clone
    ```
3.  **Install the stuff for the frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```
4.  **Install the stuff for the backend:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```
5.  **Set up the database:**

    * Make sure you have MongoDB running.
    * Put your MongoDB connection details in the backend config file (`backend/.env` or similar).
6.  **Start the backend server:**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    cd ..
    ```
7.  **Start the frontend server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start # or yarn start
    cd ..
    ```
8.  **Open your browser:** Go to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port your React app is running on). The backend might be on a different port, like `http://localhost:5000`.

## How to Deploy

To put this project online, you'll need to deploy both the frontend and backend. The backend is hosted on Render, so it might take a little time to initially load. Here's a basic idea:

1.  **Build the frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run build # or yarn build
    cd ..
    ```
    This makes a ready-to-deploy version of the React app in the `frontend/build` folder.
2.  **Configure the backend:**

    * Set up environment variables for your MongoDB connection and any sensitive info.
    * Make sure your backend knows how to use the files in the `frontend/build` folder.
3.  **Choose where to host your stuff:**

    * Frontend: Netlify, Vercel, or a simple file server.
    * Backend: Heroku, AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.
4.  **Follow the deployment instructions** for the platforms you choose.

## Future Ideas

This is just a starting point. Here are some things I could add later:

* Get real music data from an API (like the actual Spotify API).
* Let users log in and sign up.
* Let users create and manage playlists.
* Add search so you can find songs, artists, and albums.
* Make the music player better with more controls.
